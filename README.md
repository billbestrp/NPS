NPS01.py - Now Playing Script #01\
NPS02.py - Now Playing Script #02

A real-time file monitoring system that automatically posts artist and track information to the RadioPlayer API whenever your "now playing" file changes.

üéµ Overview\
The NPS01.py and NPS02.py scripts will monitor a local text file for changes and immediately posts the artist and track information to the RadioPlayer API. This eliminates the need for scheduled polling and provides instant updates whenever your broadcast system updates the now-playing information.

- NPS01/py supports legacy authentication with username:API key combination.
- NPS02.py uses X-API-KEY header authentication instead of basic authentication.

‚ú® Features

üöÄ Usage\
Basic Usage

- Set up your .env file with the required configuration
- Ensure your now playing file exists and contains the expected format

Run the script:\
`python NPS01.py`\
or
`python NPS01.py`


### Running as a Service
For production use, consider running NPS01.py as a system service:

## Windows (using NSSM)
Install NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)\
Download from: https://nssm.cc/download

### Install the service
`nssm install NPS01 "C:\Python\python.exe" "C:\path\to\NPS01.py"`
`nssm set NPS01 AppDirectory "C:\path\to\script\directory"`
`nssm start NPS01`

## Linux (using systemd)
Create /etc/systemd/system/nps01.service:\
`ini[Unit]`\
`Description=Now Playing Script v1.0`\
`After=network.target`

`[Service]`\
`Type=simple`\
`User=your-user`\
`WorkingDirectory=/path/to/script`\
`ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/NPS01.py`\
`Restart=always`\
`RestartSec=10`

`[Install]`\
`WantedBy=multi-user.target`

Enable and start:

`sudo systemctl enable nps01.service`\
`sudo systemctl start nps01.service`

üìÑ File Format
Your now playing file should contain artist and title information in this format:\
`Artist: The Beatles`\
`Title: Hey Jude`

### Format Rules

- Each line should start with either Artist: or Title:
- Case-insensitive matching (artist:, ARTIST:, etc. all work)
- Leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
- Empty lines are ignored
- Additional content in the file is ignored

### Example Files

`Simple format:`\
`Artist: Queen`\
`Title: Bohemian Rhapsody`

With additional data (ignored):\
`Station: Example FM`\
`Artist: Pink Floyd`\
`Title: Comfortably Numb`\
`Duration: 6:23`\
Album: The Wall`

üìä Logging\
NPS01.py / NPS02.py provides comprehensive logging with configurable levels:

### Log Levels

- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging (API URLs, file content, etc.)
- INFO: General operational information (file changes, successful posts)
- WARNING: Warning messages (missing data, file issues)
- ERROR: Error conditions (API failures, file access errors)

### Example Log Output

2025-06-10 14:30:15 - INFO - Started monitoring: C:\Users\BillBest\test.txt\
2025-06-10 14:30:15 - INFO - Initial file content - Artist: 'Queen', Title: 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\
2025-06-10 14:30:15 - INFO - Successfully posted: Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody\
2025-06-10 14:32:45 - INFO - File changed: C:\Users\BillBest\test.txt\
2025-06-10 14:32:45 - INFO - Extracted - Artist: 'The Beatles', Title: 'Hey Jude'\
2025-06-10 14:32:45 - INFO - Successfully posted: The Beatles - Hey Jude

üîç Troubleshooting

## Common Issues
"Required environment variable X is not set"

Solution: Ensure your .env file is in the same directory as NPS01.py and contains all required variables\

### "File not found" error

Solution: Check that the FILE_PATH in your .env file is correct and the file exists\
Note: Use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) in Windows paths\

### "API request failed" errors

Solution: Verify your API credentials and network connectivity\
Check: Ensure API_USERNAME, API_PASSWORD, and API_ENDPOINT are correct\

### No API calls being made

Solution: Check that your file contains the correct format (Artist: and Title: lines)\
Debug: Set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG to see detailed parsing information

### File Path Issues (Windows)
Windows users should use one of these path formats in their .env file:

### Forward slashes (recommended)
`FILE_PATH=C:/path/to/file/test.txt\`

### Escaped backslashes
`FILE_PATH=C:\\path\\to\\file\\test.txt`

### Raw string (if setting via Python)
`FILE_PATH=r"C:\path\to\file\test.txt"`

üèóÔ∏è Architecture\
NPS01.py / NPS02.py follows SOLID principles with a clean, modular architecture:

## Core Components

- Config: Environment variable management and validation
- FileParser: File parsing and metadata extraction logic
- RadioPlayerAPI: API communication and HTTP handling
- FileChangeHandler: Filesystem event handling and debouncing
- RadioPlayerMonitor: Main application orchestration

## Design Principles

- Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
- Dependency Injection: Clean separation of concerns
- Error Isolation: Comprehensive error handling at each layer
- Configurability: All behaviour controlled through environment variables

üîí Security Considerations

- Environment Variables: All sensitive data stored in environment variables, never hardcoded
- URL Encoding: Proper encoding of artist/title data to prevent injection attacks
- Input Validation: Validates all configuration and file data before use
- Error Handling: Doesn't expose sensitive information in error messages

üìã API Integration
NPS01.py / NPS02.py integrates with the RadioPlayer API using the following endpoint format:

`POST {API_ENDPOINT}?rpuid={RPUID}&startTime={TIMESTAMP}&title={TITLE}&artist={ARTIST}`

## Parameters

- rpuid: Your RadioPlayer station identifier
- startTime: ISO 8601 timestamp in configured timezone
- title: URL-encoded track title
- artist: URL-encoded artist name

### Authentication
NPS01.py uses HTTP Basic Authentication with your API username and password.\
NPS02.py uses X-API-KEY header authentication instead of basic authentication.
